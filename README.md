HI there! Every summer, 18 of my close childhood friends and I get together to conduct a fantasy hockey draft. The goal of the draft is to acquire players that are not owned in our leageu via a lottery based draft. This application provides the logic for conducting the lottery.

The Digs:
We do 11 round of lottery, with 4 teams entering each round. The worst teams get better odds, increasing the likelihood that they get a better drafting position, and in theory, a higher quality player. Odds follow:

Worst Seed: 50%
Second Worst: 25%
Third Worst: 15%
Fourth Worst: 10%

So, for the first round of draft, the 4 worst teams in the league have the opportunity to win the best pick. There is one caveat - a team cannot fall more than 3 draft positions. Example: 14th place (last) has the top seeded pick, and so receives 50% odds at 1st overall. If that team loses that lottery, they then enter the lottery for 2nd pick with the 50% odds. If this were to conitinue to happen until the 4th pick, that last placed team would be awarded that pick.
